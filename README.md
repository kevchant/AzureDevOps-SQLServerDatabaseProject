# SQL Database Project
Example of a [SQL database project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sql-database-projects/sql-database-projects?view=sql-server-ver16&WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-5004032%3Fview%3Dsql-server-ver16) that deploys to various different types of SQL Server related databases in Azure DevOps.Which I introduced in a blog post called 'T-SQL Tuesday 142 - Introducing my Azure DevOps templates for Data Platform deployments' (https://bit.ly/33k3N5r).

It's based on the sample AdventureWorksLT sample database provided by Microsoft.

It can use various YAML pipelines, which are in the AzureDevOpsTemplates folder.

In order to use it in Azure Pipelines you can either import or fork this repository into another GitHub repository or into Azure Repos.

Afterwards, you can select the YAML file in Azure Pipelines and tailor the pipeline to suit your needs.
